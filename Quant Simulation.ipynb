    "Arbitrage is a trading strategy that exploits inefficiencies in the price relationships between highly correlated assets. It involves the simultaneous purchase and sales of related assets to exploit short-lived variations of price. \n",

    "Your challenge is to try and identify when this happens using the data set provided, and formulate an algorithm that can take advantage of the deviation in values between the value of the 4 commodities, and the ETF that is supposed to match that value.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if at any point the ETF has a higher value than its components, there would be an arbitrage trading opportunity to sell the ETF and buy the commodities. When the prices have converged you can reverse the position to make a profit from the trade.\n"
